            <h1>JavaScript, what is it?</h1><br>
            <p>
                JavaScript, often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language that conforms to the ECMAScript specification.[10] JavaScript is high-level, often just-in-time compiled and multi-paradigm. It has dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation and first-class functions.

                Alongside <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML">HTML</a> and  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS" >CSS</a>, JavaScript is one of the core technologies of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wide_Web">World Wide Web</a>. Over 97% of websites use it client-side for web page behavior,[12] often incorporating third-party libraries.[13] All major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute the code on the user's device.
                
                As a multi-paradigm language, JavaScript supports event-driven, functional, and imperative programming styles. It has application programming interfaces (APIs) for working with text, dates, regular expressions, standard data structures, and the Document Object Model (DOM).
                
                The ECMAScript standard does not include any input/output (I/O), such as networking, storage, or graphics facilities. In practice, the web browser or other runtime system provides JavaScript APIs for I/O.
                
                JavaScript engines were originally used only in web browsers, but they are now core components of other software systems, notably servers and a variety of applications. The most popular runtime system for this usage is Node.js.
                
                Although there are similarities between JavaScript and Java, including language name, syntax, and respective standard libraries, the two languages are distinct and differ greatly in design.

            <h1>Libraries and frameworks</h1><br>
            <p>
                Over 80% of websites use a third-party JavaScript library or web framework for their client-side scripting.[13]

                jQuery is by far the most popular library, used by over 75% of websites.[13] Facebook created the React library for its website and later released it as open source; other sites, including Twitter, now use it. Likewise, the Angular framework created by Google for its websites, including YouTube and Gmail, is now an open source project used by others.[13]

                In contrast, the term "Vanilla JS" has been coined for websites not using any libraries or frameworks, instead relying entirely on standard JavaScript functionality.[38]

            <h1>History</h1><br>
            <p>
                The Mosaic web browser was released in 1993. As the first browser with a graphical user interface accessible to non-technical people, it played a prominent role in the rapid growth of the nascent World Wide Web.[14] The lead developers of Mosaic then founded the Netscape corporation, which released a more polished browser, Netscape Navigator, in 1994. Navigator quickly became the most used browser.[15]

                During these formative years of the Web, web pages could only be static, lacking the capability for dynamic behavior after the page was loaded in the browser. There was a desire in the burgeoning web development scene to remove this limitation, so in 1995, Netscape decided to add a scripting language to Navigator. They pursued two routes to achieve this: collaborating with Sun Microsystems to embed the Java programming language, while also hiring Brendan Eich to embed the Scheme language.[6]
                
                Netscape management soon decided that the best option was for Eich to devise a new language, with syntax similar to Java and less like Scheme or other extant scripting languages.[5][6] Although the new language and its interpreter implementation were called LiveScript when first shipped as part of a Navigator beta in September 1995, the name was changed to JavaScript for the official release in December.[6][1][16]
                
                The choice of the JavaScript name has caused confusion, implying that it is directly related to Java. Since Java was the hot new programming language at the time, this has been characterized as a marketing ploy by Netscape to give its own new language cachet.[17]
