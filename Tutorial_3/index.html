                    We Bare Bears is an American animated television series created by Daniel Chong for Cartoon Network. The show follows three bears, Grizzly, Panda, and Ice Bear (respectively voiced by Eric Edelstein, Bobby Moynihan, and Demetri Martin), and their awkward attempts at integrating with the human world in the San Francisco Bay Area.
                    
                    The series was based on Chong's webcomic The Three Bare Bears, and the pilot episode made its world premiere at the KLIK! Amsterdam Animation Festival, where it won in the "Young Amsterdam Audience" category. The show premiered on July 27, 2015 and ended on May 27, 2019 and ran for four seasons and 140 episodes.

                    A film adaptation, We Bare Bears: The Movie was released digitally on June 30, 2020 and later aired on Cartoon Network on September 7, 2020; it served as a conclusion to the narrative of the series. A TV spin-off, entitled We Baby Bears and focusing on the three bears when they were cubs, was announced in May 2019 to be in development and will release in 2022.

            <article class="flex-item"><p>We Bare Bears follows three adoptive brother bears: Grizzly (often called Grizz), Panda (often called Pan-Pan), and Ice Bear. The bears attempt to integrate with human society, such as by purchasing food, making human companions or trying to become famous on the Internet, although these attempts see the bears struggle to do so due to the civilized nature of humans and their own animal instincts.[5] However, in the end, they figure out that they have each other for support.[6]

                The Bears often form a "bear stack", which they use to get around the city, and has become perhaps the most recognizable image from the show.[5] Occasionally, the bears share adventures with their friends, such as child prodigy Chloe Park, bigfoot Charlie, internet sensation koala Nom Nom, park ranger Tabes, and produce saleswoman Lucy. Some flashback episodes chronicle the adventures of the bears as cubs trying to find a home.

                The show was created by cartoonist Daniel Chong, who had previously worked as a story artist for Pixar and Illumination Entertainment. The show is based on his webcomic The Three Bare Bears, which features the same characters.[7] This webcomic was uploaded online from 2010 to 2011,[8] running for ten strips. Chong has said he first drew the bears, including drawing them in a stack, in an attempt to make his girlfriend's niece laugh.[9] Chong also said that, after a different pilot he was working on did not get picked up, he wanted to pitch something else, "and this was just the closest thing near me!" Chong said that doing the comic helped a lot with the show, especially in providing the dynamic between the three main characters, though the characters have also evolved a lot from the comic.[10]

                Billed as a comedy, the show is a production of Cartoon Network Studios, which developed the program with Chong as part of their shorts development program. It was announced during the network's 2014 upfront.[6] According to Chong, much of the pilot was done with traditional watercolors, then digitally altered, to give "a naturalistic feel", but traditional work was not possible for a full show so he and the art director found a digital way to produce a "painterly feel", using references such as Peanuts cartoons, children's book illustrators like Tomi Ungerer and E. H. Shepard, and The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh.[10][11]
            
                Nom Nom and Charlie were initially voiced by Ken Jeong and Tom Arnold, respectively, before getting recast sometime before airing. Episodes, other than specials and shorts, were 11 minutes long.

            <article class="flex-item"><p>We Bare Bears has received generally positive reviews from critics. 
                
                The pilot was described by the EYE Film Institute
                Netherlands as "hilarious and endearing",

                </aside>  and it won in the "Young Amsterdam Audience" category.[20] The show was praised by Mashable for tackling "modern millennial anxieties" and for representing racial minorities; Mashable called the show "a parable about the charms and perils of an increasingly connected society".[21] Common Sense Media described the show "a funny and heartwarming story" that "sometimes poke gentle fun at hallmarks of modern society". It said that "what stands out is how the characters' uniqueness serves them well as a group" and considered it suitable for ages 8 and up.[22] The Straits Times of Singapore noted that We Bare Bears has appealed to adults as well, and said that the series stands out "because it juxtaposes a somewhat mature sense of humour with a visual style that recalls the hand-drawn illustrations from children's books."[9]

                According to Chong, fans responded positively to the human communities being ethnically diverse.[9] The Asian-American news site NextShark said that the show had gained popularity among Asian American communities because it "contains deeper messages of representation and belonging as a minority – something most Asian American children are far too familiar with." It noted that the show "unapologetically showcases and simultaneously normalizes Asian culture through their references to Panda’s love for K-pop and K-dramas, the Bears’ regular trips to their favorite boba shop, and Ice Bear's impressive ability to speak fluent Korean and cook traditional Korean dishes."</p></div>
